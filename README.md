# Camera_sensor_characterization
Electro-optical characterization of IMX219 and OAK-D cameras: dark-frame noise, photon-transfer curve, PRNU, vignetting, chromatic aberration, rolling-shutter timing, and slanted-edge MTF. Designed to produce physics-based camera parameters for realistic robotics simulation.
